# Python-Chat-Server-and-Client


Start it up, host a server or connect to a client

Use the address of the host when connecting

May need to do port forwarding


Notes:
All characters must be ascii, otherwise they will not send
Same with your nickname
Does have some bugs

Instructions  
1. Start it running  
2. Enter a nickname to be known by  
3. If you are hosting, press the "Host" button,   
4. If you are clienting (is that a verb?) press the client button and then enter the address of the host  
5. Click "Start!"
